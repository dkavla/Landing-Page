# Landing-Page
This the second project in TheOdinProject curriculum involving only HTML and CSS concepts.

The project is meant to display the basic HTML and CSS concepts I have acquired thus far. The focus of the project was mainly around the use
of Flexbox in order to align the many different containers on the webpage. 

The webpage is for a fictitious IT consulting business called Asgardian Solutions. Any and all names found on this webpage are meant to be fake and not associated with real individuals or organizations.

## To view project
In order to view project you can use the Visual Studio Code text editor and have the "Live Server" extension downloaded. In order to open the project in a browser press Command+L+O (on Mac) or Alt + L + O (on Windows). From there the project can be viewed in the window. In order to stop the Live Server go back into the editor and press Command+L+C (on Mac) or Alt+L+C (on Windows. 

The other option is to simply press "Go Live" located on the bottom of the Visiual Studio Code editor. To turn it off, you will see a circle with a line through it and the Port the project is being viewed on (Note: this is only the case if the server is running). Press that to stop the server and you will stop viewing the page.
